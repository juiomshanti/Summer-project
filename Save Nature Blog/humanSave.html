                 <h1>Why save nature?</h1>

                 <div class="project">
                 <div>Are we doing enough to preserve nature? If we do not preserve nature, we have to face a lot of difficulties and problems. If we look at the world, you see the confusion and the chaos that we encounter or face.

There is shortage of water in most of the countries. There are food shortages. People do not have proper houses to live in. There is serious pollution everywhere. Sea level is rising. Air pollution problem is very serious. We are using too many vehicles. Illicit drugs are being sold in all countries. Alcoholism has become a problem. People are under mental stress. 

Natural world is governed by the laws of biology, chemistry and physics. The planet has been there for billions of years. We are all protected and governed by nature.

A healthy environment provides nutrients that flow up the food chain, from plants to animals, to provide energy. The nutrients are then recycled to repeat the process.

We must understand these very basic principles of nature and try to live with nature. We should not depend too much on concrete structures and all sort of chemicals.

By preserving nature, the planet and all its inhabitants are guaranteed a constant supply of clean water and fresh air.

We very often go against nature. We depend too much on artificial things. We want air conditioned rooms. We do not like to walk. We do not like to prepare our meals. We want everything readymade. 

Trees produce the oxygen that humans and other animals need to breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that they exhale. Trees absorb airborne pollutants such as carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide. They also remove toxins from the soil and help to reduce noise pollution.

We do not realise the importance of nature. We try to destroy nature. See the man-elephant conflict. See how many water collecting areas we have filled and constructed concrete structures; how many trees we are destroying daily. How many are planting trees. Is not this a very tragic situation?

Clean water is necessary for all living things. All animals and plants are made mostly of water and require a constant supply of clean water to remain healthy. 

How many water preserving areas have we destroyed? How many rivers and tanks have we misused and have become polluted?

Water falls to Earth as rain to water plants, provide drinking water for animals, and maintain rivers, lakes and oceans. It evaporates and forms the clouds that then release rain to repeat the water cycle.

We must understand this process or the cycle and preserve the nature. We must protect the environment. Nature has given us rivers, canals, lakes, oceans and forests. There are various types of birds and animals. We must protect wildlife. 

Overbuilt environments disrupt and overwhelm nature’s processes by removing trees and polluting the water and air, which leads to decreased biodiversity and overall natural health. 

Let us think about nature more seriously. Let us respect nature. Let us live close to nature. Let us protect wildlife. Let us not cut trees and build concrete structures everywhere. Animals are not destroying the environment. It is we who destroy the environment and make even the animals also suffer.</div>

                 <h1>How to save nature?</h1>

                 <div class="project">
                 <div>1. We’re analyzing satellite images and local yield potential to pinpoint where soy farming and cattle ranching can expand without destroying nature. This approach is especially vital in Brazil’s Cerrado region, where half of all natural habitat has already been converted to cropland and pasture. Cooperating with farmers on sustainable practices can help save what’s left of the Cerrado’s rich savanna.<br>
<br>
2. We’re making it fast, easy and affordable for fishers to use data to manage their catches more sustainably. Like image recognition software, FishFace technology we’re pioneering in Indonesia uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to identify fish species and track their numbers so fishers can avoid catching too many or the wrong kind.<br>
<br>
3. We’re championing regulations that allow former mining lands to be repurposed for solar and wind energy. Tens of thousands of acres of degraded mine sites in Nevada’s Great Basin are now available for renewable energy development. By targeting already-disturbed land, new turbines and solar panels won’t need to destroy more natural habitat.

                 <h1>What can I do?</h1>

                 <div class="project">
                 <div><b>1.	Use Reusable Bags </b><br>

Plastic grocery-type bags that get thrown out end up in landfills or in other parts of the environment. These can suffocate animals who get stuck in them or may mistake them for food. Also, it takes a while for the bags to decompose. 
<br><br>
<b>2.	Print as Little as Necessary </b><br>

We have all had that teacher that wanted us to have a copy of every single reading when we come to class, or that professor who wanted a hard copy of the ten-page paper that is due next week. These are fine but it seems as if they do not understand that using so much paper is detrimental to the environment.
<br><br>
<b>3.	Recycle </b><br>

Recycling is such a simple thing to do, but so many people don’t do it. Many garbage disposal companies offer recycling services, so check with the company you use to see if they can help you get started! It is as simple as getting a bin and putting it out with your trash cans for free!
<br><br>
<b>4.	Use a Reusable Beverage Containers </b><br>

Instead of buying individually-packaged drinks, consider buying a bulk container of the beverage you want and buying a reusable water bottle. Not only will this help the environment, but it will also help you save money since you are buying a bulk container.
<br><br>
<b>5.	Don’t Throw Your Notes Away </b><br>

At the end of the semester, students are often stuck with notes they don’t need anymore, especially from GenEd classes that had little, if anything, to do with their major. 
<br><br>
<b>6.	Save Electricity! </b><br>

Use energy-efficient light bulbs instead of regular bulbs. They last longer, which will save you a bit of money (every little bit helps on a college budget, right?).
<br><br>
<b>7.	Save Water</b><br>

Water is wasted more frequently than we can see. Turn off the faucet as you are brushing your teeth. Don’t turn your shower on until you’re ready to get in and wash your hair.  Limit your water usage as you wash dishes. Changing old habits will be good for both the environment and your wallet!
<br><br>
<b>8.	Avoid Taking Cars or Carpool When Possible</b><br>

Cars are harmful to the environment. Taking public transportation, walking, or riding a bike to class are better options that help the environment and your budget, as well as getting some exercise in!

                 <h1>Plant your first Tree!</h1>

				 <ul>
    <li><b>Locate all underground utilities prior to digging.</b>
	<br><br></li>
    <li><b>Identify the trunk flare.</b> The trunk flare is where the trunk expands at the base of the tree. This point should be partially visible after the tree has been planted.
    <br><br></li>
	<li><b>Dig a shallow, broad planting hole.</b> Holes should be 2-3 times wider than the root ball, but only as deep as the root ball.
    <br><br></li>
	<li><b>Remove the containers or cut away the wire basket.</b> Inspect container tree root balls for circling roots. Straighten, cut, or remove them.
    <br><br></li>
	<li><b>Place the tree at the proper height.</b> Take care to dig the hole to the proper depth – and no more. If the tree is planted too deep, new roots will have difficulty developing because of a lack of oxygen.
    <br><br></li>
	<li><b>Straighten the tree in the hole.</b> Before backfilling, have someone view the tree from several directions to confirm it is straight.
    <br><br></li>
	<li><b>Fill the hole gently, but firmly.</b> Pack soil around the base of the root ball to stabilize it. Fill the remainder of the hole, firmly packing the soil to eliminate air pockets that may dry out roots. Further reduce air pockets by watering periodically while backfilling. Avoid fertilization at the time of planting.
    <br><br></li>
	<li><b>Stake the tree, if necessary.</b> Studies have shown that trees establish more quickly and develop stronger trunk and root systems if they are not staked at the time of planting.
    <br><br></li>
	<li><b>Mulch the base of the tree.</b> Mulch is organic matter spread around the base of a tree to hold moisture, moderate soil temperature extremes, and reduce grass and weed competition.
    <br><br></li>
	<li><b>Provide follow-up care.</b> Keep the soil moist, but not water-logged. Water trees at least once a week, barring rain, and more frequently during hot, windy weather.
	</li></ul>
